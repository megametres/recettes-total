# Recettes

WIP :: I target to create a recipe app that can grab recipe from website and add it to a personnal collection.

For now the recipe api is created with rust + diesel + postgresql + rocket

The front-end is with angular

This repo is only used for regroup, deployment and management of all part of the application.
